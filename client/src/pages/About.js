              The field of architecture is inherently critical. For decades, the
              field has been dominated by powerful and already-established
              voices. Facadebook is an interactive social platform to open the
              dialogue to all fans (and haters) of architecture.

              Reviews are posted under pseudonyms, and anyone in the community
              can add a new building to be reviewed. A fun feature (bug?) is the
              ability to edit anyone's reviews and twist their words however
              you'd like! When I learn encription that may change.
